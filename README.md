# Employee-Retention-Prediction
My machine-Learning model project for the HR Department for Employee Retebtion/Attrition Perdiction
I Built a machine-learning model for the HR department to help them predict if an employee will stay or leave the company.

This kind of project is very important to the HRs department because they want to retain their employees.

  Steps I took in building this project 
• I carried out exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
•  plotted a bar chart.
•Find the average of the numeric parameters of the datasets.
•Build Logistic Regression using the sklearn model on the parameters narrowed down in my exploratory analysis.
•One hot encoding on the categorical variable for my machine-learning model.
•Used train_test_split good strategy to split my training data.
•Made a prediction using my test data.
•Measured the accuracy of my model.

1. Carried out exploratory data analysis on all the parameters we have, to find out which factors affect employee retention /attrition.
2. ⁠Plotted a bar chart showing the impact of employees' salaries on retention and the correlation between department and employees' retention.
  ~The output of this shows employees with high salaries are likely to not leave the company.
~ For the department on employee retention, shows some impact but not major, hence I ignored the department in my analysis.

3. Find the Average of the numerical parameters in the dataset.
 From the displayed table the following conclusion was drawn.
~ Satisfaction Level: The satisfaction level seems to be relatively low (0.44) in employees leaving the firm vs the retained ones(0.66).
~Average monthly hours: Average monthly hours are higher in employees leaving the firm(199 vs 207).
~ Promotion last 5 years: Employees who are given promotions are likely to be retained at the firm.

4. Build a Logistic Regression using the parameters I narrowed done that affect employees' retention.
5. ⁠ One Hot Encoding on the categorical parameter.
6. ⁠Used train_test_split which is a good strategy to split my training data.
7. ⁠Made a prediction using my test data.
 8. Measured the accuracy of my model.
